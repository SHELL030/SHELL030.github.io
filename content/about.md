Hi, I would like to introduce myself.

<style>
  .overview-title {
    text-align: left;      /* 居左对齐 */
    font-weight: bold;     /* 加粗 */
    font-size: 1.2em;      /* 大一号字（默认1em，建议1.2-2em） */

<h2 class="overview-title">I am obsessed with transforming chaos into order—that's why I chose sustainability.</h2>

I have always believed data is the world's hidden language. As a mathematical modeling enthusiast and piano player with 20+ years of experience, I excel at discerning patterns in seemingly disordered numbers, much like interpreting emotional cadences in a musical score.
<br><br>
During a math modeling competition, our team developed a corporate credit rating model integrating environmental risks. By analyzing non-financial metrics (e.g., environmental compliance costs, carbon asset volatility's impact on solvency), I discovered that delta increase in environmental risk exposure led to 18% increase in default probabilities. This revelation cemented my conviction: sustainability requires digital tools to cut through the fog of business decisions—a conviction that guides my career today.
<br><br>
<h2 class="overview-title">Then I began working on data-driven green transition projects.</h2>
During my internship at Ping An Tech's Climate Risk Analytics Group, I led a quantitative analysis project assessing transition risks for coal-fired power enterprises under varying climate scenarios. However, I recognized that effective environmental risk management must be deeply coupled with specific engineering contexts to yield practical significance.
<br><br>
During my involvement in Google Cloud's AI for Sustainability Solutions initiative, I spearheaded the operational deployment of data analytics tools, developing and proposing digital sustainability solutions tailored for the cement and solid waste management sectors. Additionally, I contributed to the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) in completing the Environmental Credit project, focusing on bridging policy design with practical implementation to advance regulatory refinements—similar to the green finance mechanisms under China's Beautiful China Initiative. 
<br><br>
<h2 class="overview-title">Professional Vision: To Be an Engineer of Sustainable Development</h2>

I steadfastly adhere to the principle that "No sustainability without profitability". By leveraging a three-dimensional competency in risk quantification, business acumen, and policy fluency, I aim to help enterprises chart profitable pathways aligned with SDGs—just as I once demonstrated through rigorous algorithms in mathematical modeling competitions that environmental stewardship and economic growth are never mutually exclusive choices.
